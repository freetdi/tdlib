# treedec

**treedec** provides tree decomposition algorithms.

A tree decomposition of a simple, loopless, undirected graph G is a tree T
with bags at its nodes containing vertices from G. The usual conditions apply.
By convention, a tree is an acyclic graph with exactly one connected component.
The bagsize of T is the size of the biggest bag, which is a notion for the
(width of T) + 1.

There is work in progress, so this description should be understood as
normative. Deviations from conventions stated here are considered bugs.

## Prerequisites

- boost (tested with >=1.62)
- a C++ compiler with reasonable C++ support

Optional:

- Python/Cython (disable with `--without-python`)
- gala headers; will be detected, if available, by configure
  (need `libboost_graph` in that case)

## The interface

A tree decomposition algorithm is a class template
```C++
template<class G, template<class G_, class ...> class C>
class ALGORITHM{
[..]
};
```
where `G` is a graph and `C` is a config object. A graph is expected to come
with a boost graph interface. There are some extra implicit assumptions,
which the graph data structure may or may not enforce.

An algorithm has (should have) a constructor taking `G&` and a constructor
taking `const G&`. You should expect the argument to be modified, unless it's
`const`, i.e. make sure to cast to `const` reference, if this is not desired.

An algorithm also provides
```C++
T get_tree_decomposition() const;
template<class TT>
void get_tree_decomposition(TT&) const;
```
which is meant to work with `treedecomposition` types (see below).

In namespace `treedec` we currently have (needs verification)
```C++
prep::*        // preprocessing
he::fill_in    // fillIn heuristic
he::min_degree // minDegree heuristic
he::thorup     // thorups heuristic
ex::ta         // tamakis algorithm
ex::cutset     // exact algorithm
comb::PP_FI    // preprocessing + fill_in
comb::PP_FI_TM // preprocessing + fill_in + triangulation
comb::ex17     // PACE 17 exact (pp + tamaki)
```

## Graph types

A graph is expected to be a model of `AdjacencyGraph`, but without self loops
and without parallel edges. It needs to be undirected.
Some algorithms support graphs that model `BidirectionalGraph`. These graphs
must not contain more than one edge for any two vertices, as accessed through
`boost::edges`.

## Configuration objects

Config objects can control some of the algorithm behaviour, such as

- statistics generation,
- debug output,
- signalling,
- selection of subalgorithm, subroutine and data structure.

The default, `algo::cfg_default`, is a sensible choice, if you don't care.

(TODO: more on config objects)

## Tree decompositions

A tree decomposition is an undirected graph in the above sense
with a vertex property of access type `treedec::bag_t`. Sometimes
bidirectional graphs also work. In that case, the edges of the
tree decomposition must be oriented away from a root vertex. 

The expected models are
```C++
#include <treedec/treedec_traits.hpp>
typedef std::vector<vertex_descriptor> bag_container_type;
typedef boost::adjacency_list<boost::vecS, boost::vecS, boost::undirectedS,
        boost::property<treedec::bag_t, bag_container_type> > T;
```
or
```C++
typedef boost::adjacency_list<boost::setS, boost::vecS, boost::undirectedS,
        boost::property<treedec::bag_t, bag_container_type> > T;
```
where `vertex_descriptor` must be compatible with the graph to be decomposed.

It is possible to use custom tree decomposition types, such as with bundled
properties. If you have a graph
```C++
struct mybundle{
   std::set<unsigned> bag; // must be "bag" right now.
   [..]
};
typedef boost::adjacency_list<boost::vecS, boost::vecS, boost::undirectedS,
                              mybundle> my_td_type;
```
you can make bags accessible from treedec using
```C++
TREEDEC_TREEDEC_BAG_TRAITS(my_td_type, bag);
```

## tdecomp

An example driver. Reads in `.gr` files (PACE style) and ejects `.td`.
Supports several algorithms. These can be switched on individually,
using options such as `--pp`, `--fi`, `--ppfi`, `--ex17`. Selected
algorithms run in parallel, some heuristics permit interruption
using a `TERM` signal. In the interrupted case, the best currently known
decomposition is printed.

Example:
```console
$ tdecomp --fi < my_graph.gr > my_decomposition.td
$ td-validate my_graph.gr my_decomposition.td
```
