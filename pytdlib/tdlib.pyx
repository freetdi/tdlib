Interface with TdLib (algorithms for tree decompositions)

This module defines functions based on TdLib, a
library that implements algorithms for tree
decompositions written by Lukas Larisch. 

Definition:

A tree decomposition of a graph G is a pair (T, b) consisting of a graph T and 
a function b: V(T) -> 2^{V(G)} associating with each vertex t in V(T) a set of 
vertices b(t), called bags of T, that are subsets of V(G) such that 

(T1) T is a tree,

(T2) every vertex v in V(G) is contained in some bag of T,

(T3) for every edge e in E(G) there is a node t in V(T) with e is a subset of 
b(t), and

(T4) for all v in V(G) the set b^{-1} := {t in V(T): v in b(t)} is non-empty 
and connected in T.

The width of (T, b) is defined as max{|b(t)|-1: t in V(T) }.
The treewidth of G is defined as the minimum width over all tree decompositions 
of G.

Some known results:

    - Trees have treewidth 1
    - Cycles have treewidth 2
    - Series-parallel graphs have treewidth at most 2
    - Cliques must be contained in some bag of a tree decomposition

Computing the treewidth or a tree decomposition of a given graph is NP-hard in
general.

This module containes the following functions** :

    - preprocessing   
        Applies save reduction rules to a given graph

    - PP_MD
        Applies preprocessing followed by the minDegree-heuristic to a given 
        graph

    - PP_FI_TM
        Applies preprocessing followed by the minFill-heuristic followed by 
        triangulation minimization to a given graph

    - preprocessing_glue_bags
        Glues the given bags with a given tree decomposition according to 
        subset-relation

    - lower_bound
        Computes a lower bound with respect to treewidth of a given graph

    - treedecomposition_exact_cutset
        Computes a tree decomposition of exact width of a given graph 
        (faster than the dynamic version in practice)

    - treedecomposition_exact_cutset_decision
        Computes a tree decomposition of exact width of a given graph
        and returns true, if tw(G) <= k. Otherwise false will be returned

    - treedecomposition_exact_dynamic
        Computes a tree decomposition of exact width of a given graph 
        (asymptotically faster than the greedy version)

    - seperator_algorithm
        Computes a 4-approximate tree decomposition of a given graph

    - minDegree_ordering
        Computes an elimination ordering according to the minDegree-heuristic
    
    - fillIn_ordering
        Computes an elimination ordering according to the minFill-heuristic

    - MSVS
        Possibly reduces the width of a given tree decomposition with help 
        of minimal seperating vertex sets
    
    - minimalChordal
        Possibly reduces the width of a given tree decomposition by 
        triangulation minimization

    - treedec_to_ordering
        Computes an elimination ordering out of a tree decomposition
    
    - ordering_to_treedec
        Computes a tree decomposition out of an elimination ordering

    - trivial_decomposition
        Returns a trivial decomposition of a given graph
    
    - get_width
        Returns the width of a given tree decomposition
    
    - is_valid_treedecomposition
        Checks, if a tree decomposition is valid with respect to a given graph
